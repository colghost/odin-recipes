This is a culmination of a few weeks of following the odin project.  

I've done some HTML work before, but incorporating it into GITHUB is new.

I'm excited to continue on and see where this takes me.


// POST PROJECT THOUGHTS

Finding out how exactly to get the project from here to github was...interesting.

First thing that helped was "git status", which showed all of the changed projects that needed to be committed and then pushed.

Second thing was "git add" and then adding every new change that was highlighted in "git status".

Third thing was "git commit", leaving a littl "-m" to describe what I actually did with the project.  Obviously adding the entire project all at once, everything gets updated with the same commit message.

Fourth and MOST IMPORTANT FOR MY SANITY is to "git push" so that the current workspace repository gets pushed onto github proper.  I spent entirely too long refreshing the github repo only to realize I needed to PUSH the project out.  Whoops.

Setting up github to display the site was a process but I eventually figured out how to host my HTML site from github.  

Next dealio will be learning some CSS I guess.  See ya on the other side!
